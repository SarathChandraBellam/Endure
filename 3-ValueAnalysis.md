# Round 2 – Value Analysis

The value analysis round determines whether a shortlisted stock is truly worth buying. The goal is to check if the stock's Current Market Price (CMP) is significantly lower than its intrinsic value.

## What You'll Do

1. **Understand Key Parameters** – Learn what CMP, Intrinsic Value, and EPS Growth Rate mean
2. **Calculate Intrinsic Value** – Use historical P/E data to find the stock's true worth
3. **Make the Decision** – Compare CMP with Intrinsic Value and decide: Buy or No Buy

## The Files

- **[3.2-ValueAnalysis-KeyParameters.md](3.2-ValueAnalysis-KeyParameters.md)** – Detailed explanation of CMP, Intrinsic Value (IV), and EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)
- **[3.3-ValueAnalysis-CoreCalculationSteps.md](3.3-ValueAnalysis-CoreCalculationSteps.md)** – Step-by-step guide to calculating P/E, Intrinsic P/E, Intrinsic Value, and PEG ratio
- **[3.4-ValueAnalysis-BuyNoByDecision.md](3.4-ValueAnalysis-BuyNoByDecision.md)** – Decision framework: when to buy, when to wait, and when to walk away

## Quick Summary

**The 20% Rule**: Only buy when CMP is at least 20% below Intrinsic Value.

**Example**:
- Intrinsic Value = ₹500
- Current Market Price = ₹380
- Margin of Safety = 24%
- **Decision: Buy**

**Validation**: Use PEG ratio as a secondary check:
- PEG < 1 → Stock is undervalued
- PEG > 1 → Stock is overvalued

## Where to Find Data

- **Current Market Price** – Any financial portal (moneycontrol.com, screener.in)
- **EPS Data** – Company annual reports, financial portals
- **Historical P/E** – screener.in, moneycontrol.com, company investor relations

## The Outcome

Only stocks where the CMP is significantly below the Intrinsic Value (typically 20% or more) pass Round 2. Everything else is eliminated.

**A stock with perfect stability but a high price is still a "No Buy."**
