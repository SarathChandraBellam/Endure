# Round 2 – Value Analysis

The value analysis round determines whether a shortlisted stock is truly worth buying. The goal is to check if the stock's Current Market Price (CMP) is significantly lower than its intrinsic value.

## 3.1 Core Philosophy

Investing in stocks is buying a part of a company, not just a piece of paper.

**Bargain Hunting**
Great investors demonstrate infinite patience and wait for a bargain price that is much below the intrinsic value of the stock.

**Safety and Logic**
The process is disciplined and logical. A "No Buy" decision is as good as a "Buy" decision, if not more so. Buying the wrong stock has far more disastrous consequences than simply missing a stock worth buying.

**The Single Guarantee**
There is only one guarantee in the stock market: stock homecoming. A stock can divert from its intrinsic value for an indefinite period, but it will eventually come back home to its true intrinsic value.

## 3.2 Key Parameters

### 3.2.1 Current Market Price (CMP)

The CMP is the price at which investors are ready to buy and sell the stock today.

- **Market Perception** – The CMP represents collective market perception about the stock. It is the Price you can see.
- **No Clue of Worthiness** – The CMP alone gives no clue of a stock's worthiness to be bought or sold. For example, a stock trading at a 52-week low gives no indication of its true value.

### 3.2.2 Intrinsic Value (IV)

The intrinsic value is the stock's true worth.

- **Actual Value** – Intrinsic value represents the Cost of the business, which is usually hidden and must be calculated via value analysis.
- **Reference for Decisions** – Finding this intrinsic value is the key to wise buy or sell decisions. The decision should be based on comparing the CMP with the IV.
- **Stability** – Intrinsic value is driven by hard business numbers and should not change daily. It needs to be revisited and recalibrated at least once a year because the company's worth changes over time due to inflation and earnings growth.

### 3.2.3 EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)

EPS-GR is the average rate at which earnings are growing for the stock.

- **Prediction Tool** – The primary use of calculating EPS-GR (other than confirming stability) is to help predict the intrinsic value of the stock after a number of years (e.g., 5 years ahead).
- **Investment Growth Driver** – The company's growth rate is different from the growth rate of the investment. A high EPS-GR combined with a cheap entry price provides the best potential returns.

## 3.3 Core Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Calculate P/E Ratio

**P/E Ratio = Current Market Price (CMP) ÷ Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

The P/E ratio indicates the premium investors are willing to pay for every rupee of current earnings.

- P/E comparisons are only meaningful within similar industries.
- A high P/E may suggest overvaluation or expected growth; a low P/E may suggest undervaluation or concerns.

### Step 2: Calculate Intrinsic P/E (P/E©)

The Intrinsic P/E is calculated by:
1. Finding the P/E ratio for each year over an extended period (7 to 10 years)
2. Calculating the average, excluding outliers caused by market crashes or anomalies

**Why This Matters**
This ratio is stable, robust, and reliable. It is the primary input for determining the Intrinsic Value.

### Step 3: Calculate Intrinsic Value (IV)

**Intrinsic Value = Intrinsic P/E© × Current EPS**

This calculated value represents the stock's true worth. The buy decision hinges on comparing CMP with IV.

### Step 4: Calculate PEG Ratio

**PEG Ratio = P/E ÷ Annual EPS Growth Rate (as a percentage)**

This ratio validates the valuation by connecting historical performance (P/E) with future growth potential.

- **PEG < 1** – Stock is likely undervalued; high P/E is justified by growth
- **PEG > 1** – Stock is likely overvalued

## 3.4 The Buy/No Buy Decision

### 3.4.1 Primary Decision: CMP vs. Intrinsic Value

**Buy Signal**
The stock is a "Buy" when the CMP is significantly below the Intrinsic Value (IV).

- **Common Guideline**: Enter the market when CMP is more than 20% below the intrinsic value.
- Example: If IV = ₹100, consider buying when CMP ≤ ₹80

**No Buy Signal**
A "No Buy" decision is required if:
- The CMP is significantly higher than the IV
- The CMP is close to or above even the "most optimistic value"

### 3.4.2 Validation: PEG Ratio Check

- **PEG Ratio < 1** → Stock is likely undervalued
- **PEG Ratio > 1** → Stock is likely overvalued

Use this as a secondary check to validate your buy/no buy decision.

### 3.4.3 Calculation Quality Check

Ensure the Intrinsic P/E© is calculated over:
- An extended period (7 to 10 years)
- By averaging annual P/E values
- Excluding outliers caused by market crashes or other anomalies

## Where to Find Data

- **Current Market Price (CMP)** – Any financial portal or stock exchange website
- **EPS Data** – Company annual reports, screener.in, moneycontrol.com
- **Historical P/E Data** – Financial portals, investor presentations
- **EPS Growth Rate** – Calculate from historical EPS data or use analyst reports

## The Outcome

Only stocks where the CMP is significantly below the Intrinsic Value (typically 20% or more) advance to the next round. Everything else is eliminated, regardless of how stable the earnings are.

A stock with perfect stability but a high price is still a "No Buy."
