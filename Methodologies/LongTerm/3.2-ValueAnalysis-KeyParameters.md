# 3.2 Key Parameters

The three core parameters in value analysis are Current Market Price (CMP), Intrinsic Value (IV), and EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR). Understanding these parameters is essential for making informed buy/no buy decisions.

## 3.2.1 Current Market Price (CMP)

**Definition**
The CMP is the price at which investors are ready to buy and sell the stock today.

**What It Represents**
- **Market Perception** – The CMP represents collective market perception about the stock.
- **Visible Price** – It is the Price you can see on any stock exchange or financial portal.
- **Constantly Changing** – The CMP fluctuates throughout trading hours based on supply and demand.

**What It Does NOT Tell You**
- **No Clue of Worthiness** – The CMP alone gives no clue of a stock's worthiness to be bought or sold.
- **Example**: A stock trading at a 52-week low gives no indication of whether it is undervalued or deteriorating.
- **Another Example**: A stock at a 52-week high may be overvalued or may still have room to grow.

**Where to Find It**
- Stock exchange websites (NSE, BSE)
- Financial portals (moneycontrol.com, screener.in, investing.com)
- Broker platforms

**Key Insight**
The CMP is the market's opinion. The intrinsic value is the truth. Your job is to compare the two.

## 3.2.2 Intrinsic Value (IV)

**Definition**
The intrinsic value is the stock's true worth—what the business is actually worth independent of market sentiment.

**What It Represents**
- **Actual Value** – Intrinsic value represents the Cost of the business, which is usually hidden and must be calculated via value analysis.
- **Hidden Truth** – Unlike CMP (which is visible), IV must be discovered through calculation.
- **Business Reality** – IV is driven by hard business numbers: earnings, assets, cash flow, and growth potential.

**Why It Matters**
- **Reference for Decisions** – Finding this intrinsic value is the key to wise buy or sell decisions.
- **The decision should be based on comparing the CMP with the IV**, not on market trends or tips.
- **Stock Homecoming Anchor** – The intrinsic value is "home"—the place the stock will eventually return to.

**Stability and Recalibration**
- **Stability** – Intrinsic value is driven by hard business numbers and should not change daily.
- **Annual Review** – It needs to be revisited and recalibrated at least once a year because the company's worth changes over time due to:
  - Inflation
  - Earnings growth
  - Changes in business fundamentals

**How to Calculate It**
**Intrinsic Value = Intrinsic P/E© × Current EPS**

(See 3.3-CoreCalculationSteps.md for the full calculation process.)

**Key Insight**
Intrinsic value is not a guess—it is a calculated estimate based on long-term business performance. It is your north star in the chaos of daily price movements.

## 3.2.3 EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)

**Definition**
EPS-GR is the average rate at which the earnings per share are growing for the stock, typically calculated over 5 to 10 years.

**What It Represents**
- **Historical Growth Pattern** – Shows how consistently and how fast the company has grown its earnings.
- **Future Growth Proxy** – While past growth doesn't guarantee future growth, consistent historical growth increases the probability of future stability.

**Primary Uses**

### 1. Prediction Tool
- The primary use of calculating EPS-GR (other than confirming stability in Round 1) is to help **predict the intrinsic value of the stock after a number of years** (e.g., 5 years ahead).
- Formula for future EPS:
  - **Future EPS = Current EPS × (1 + EPS-GR)^n**
  - Where n = number of years

### 2. Investment Growth Driver
- **The company's growth rate is different from the growth rate of the investment.**
- A high EPS-GR combined with a cheap entry price (found through intrinsic value calculation) provides the best potential returns.
- Example:
  - A company growing at 15% per year is valuable.
  - But if you buy it at 50% below intrinsic value, your investment growth accelerates far beyond 15%.

**How to Calculate It**
Calculate the year-over-year EPS growth for each year, then find the average (CAGR is preferred):

**EPS-GR (CAGR) = [(Ending EPS / Beginning EPS)^(1/n)] - 1**

Where n = number of years

**Example**
- Year 1 EPS: ₹10
- Year 5 EPS: ₹18
- EPS-GR = [(18/10)^(1/4)] - 1 = 15.8%

**Where to Find EPS Data**
- Company annual reports
- Financial portals (screener.in, moneycontrol.com)
- Investor presentations

**Key Insight**
EPS-GR connects the past with the future. It tells you how fast the business is compounding and helps you project where it will be in 5 years. Combined with a bargain entry price, it is the engine of investment returns.

## Summary Table

| Parameter | Type | Visibility | Changes | Use |
|-----------|------|------------|---------|-----|
| **CMP** | Market Price | Visible (daily) | Every second | Compare with IV |
| **IV** | True Worth | Hidden (calculated) | Annually | Buy/Sell reference point |
| **EPS-GR** | Growth Rate | Hidden (calculated) | Annually | Future value projection & validation |

---

## Key Takeaway

- **CMP** is what the market thinks.
- **IV** is what the business is worth.
- **EPS-GR** is how fast the business is growing.

Your job is to buy when CMP is significantly below IV, while ensuring EPS-GR supports future growth. These three parameters form the foundation of every value analysis decision.
