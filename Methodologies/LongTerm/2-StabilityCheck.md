# Round 1 – Stability Check

The stability check is the second elimination round. It ensures a stock has predictable earnings growth before we invest time in deeper analysis.

## What to Check

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)** – the company's profit divided by the number of shares. This is the single most important number the market watches.

## Time Period

Look back at least **5 years** of EPS data. Recent performance (last 5 years) matters more than older history.

## What You're Looking For

Year-over-year EPS growth that is:
- **Positive** – earnings are growing, not shrinking
- **Consistent** – no major swings between big gains and big losses

## What Fails

Any stock with unstable earnings:
- Negative growth in 2 or more of the last 5 years
- Wild fluctuations (e.g., +40%, -25%, +50%, -30%)
- Unpredictable patterns that make future projections unreliable

## Why This Matters

Stability equals predictability. Without consistent growth, you cannot reasonably forecast where the business will be in 5 years. High unpredictability means high risk.

A stable earnings pattern signals competitive advantage, recurring demand, and a business worth analyzing further.

## Where to Find EPS Data

- Company annual reports (Investor Relations section on company website)
- Reliable financial portals (screener.in, moneycontrol.com, etc.)

## The Outcome

Only stocks with stable, positive EPS growth over 5 years advance to Round 2. Everything else is eliminated.
