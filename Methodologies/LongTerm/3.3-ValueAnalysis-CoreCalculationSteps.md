# 3.3 Core Calculation Steps

Value analysis requires four key calculations. Follow these steps in sequence to determine a stock's intrinsic value and validate its worthiness for purchase.

## Step 1: Calculate Current P/E Ratio

### Formula
**P/E Ratio = Current Market Price (CMP) ÷ Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

### What It Means
The P/E ratio indicates the premium investors are willing to pay for every rupee of current earnings.

- **High P/E**: Investors expect high future growth, or the stock may be overvalued.
- **Low P/E**: The stock may be undervalued, or investors have concerns about future growth.

### Important Notes
- P/E comparisons are only meaningful within similar industries.
- A P/E of 25 may be normal for IT companies but high for manufacturing companies.
- The current P/E alone does not tell you whether to buy or sell.

### Example
- CMP = ₹500
- Current EPS = ₹20
- **P/E = 500 ÷ 20 = 25**

### Where to Find the Data
- **CMP**: Any financial portal or stock exchange website
- **Current EPS**: Company annual report, screener.in, moneycontrol.com

## Step 2: Calculate Intrinsic P/E (P/E©)

### What It Is
The Intrinsic P/E (denoted as P/E©) is the **average P/E ratio over an extended period**, typically 7 to 10 years, excluding outliers.

### Why It Matters
- The current P/E fluctuates daily with market sentiment.
- The Intrinsic P/E is stable, robust, and reliable.
- It represents the **true, long-term valuation** that the market has historically assigned to the stock.
- It is the **primary input for determining the Intrinsic Value**.

### Calculation Process

**Step 2.1: Collect Historical P/E Data**
- Gather P/E ratios for each year over the past 7 to 10 years.
- Sources: Financial portals, company investor relations, historical data from screener.in

**Step 2.2: Exclude Outliers**
- Remove P/E values caused by market crashes (e.g., 2008, 2020 COVID crash).
- Remove P/E values caused by one-time events (e.g., extraordinary losses or gains).
- Outliers distort the average and make it unreliable.

**Step 2.3: Calculate the Average**
- Add up the remaining P/E values and divide by the number of years.

**Intrinsic P/E© = Sum of P/E values (excluding outliers) ÷ Number of years**

### Example
| Year | P/E | Note |
|------|-----|------|
| 2024 | 24 | |
| 2023 | 22 | |
| 2022 | 20 | |
| 2021 | 26 | |
| 2020 | 12 | Market crash—exclude |
| 2019 | 23 | |
| 2018 | 21 | |
| 2017 | 25 | |

- **Excluded**: 2020 (crash year)
- **Sum**: 24 + 22 + 20 + 26 + 23 + 21 + 25 = 161
- **Count**: 7 years
- **Intrinsic P/E© = 161 ÷ 7 = 23**

### Key Insight
The Intrinsic P/E© is the bedrock of value analysis. It smooths out market noise and gives you the true, long-term valuation anchor.

## Step 3: Calculate Intrinsic Value (IV)

### Formula
**Intrinsic Value (IV) = Intrinsic P/E© × Current EPS**

### What It Means
This calculated value represents the **stock's true worth** based on its historical valuation and current earnings.

### Why It Matters
- The buy decision hinges on comparing **CMP with IV**.
- If CMP is significantly below IV, the stock is undervalued.
- If CMP is close to or above IV, the stock is fairly valued or overvalued.

### Example
- **Intrinsic P/E©** = 23 (from Step 2)
- **Current EPS** = ₹20
- **Intrinsic Value = 23 × 20 = ₹460**

### Interpretation
- If the **CMP is ₹500**, the stock is trading **above intrinsic value** → **No Buy**.
- If the **CMP is ₹360**, the stock is trading **22% below intrinsic value** → **Strong Buy Signal**.

### Key Insight
The Intrinsic Value is "home"—the place the stock will eventually return to. Buying significantly below IV gives you a margin of safety and sets the stage for stock homecoming to work in your favor.

## Step 4: Calculate PEG Ratio

### Formula
**PEG Ratio = P/E ÷ Annual EPS Growth Rate (as a percentage)**

### What It Means
The PEG ratio validates the valuation by connecting:
- **Historical performance** (P/E)
- **Future growth potential** (EPS-GR)

It answers the question: "Is the current P/E justified by the company's growth rate?"

### Interpretation
- **PEG < 1**: Stock is likely **undervalued**. The high P/E (if present) is justified by growth.
- **PEG = 1**: Stock is fairly valued relative to its growth.
- **PEG > 1**: Stock is likely **overvalued**. The P/E is too high given the growth rate.

### Example
- **Current P/E** = 25
- **Annual EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)** = 20%
- **PEG = 25 ÷ 20 = 1.25**

**Interpretation**: PEG > 1 suggests the stock may be **overvalued** relative to its growth.

### Another Example
- **Current P/E** = 25
- **Annual EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)** = 30%
- **PEG = 25 ÷ 30 = 0.83**

**Interpretation**: PEG < 1 suggests the stock is **undervalued** relative to its growth potential.

### Where to Find EPS Growth Rate
- Calculate it yourself from historical EPS data (see 3.2-KeyParameters.md for formula).
- Use analyst reports or financial portals (screener.in often provides EPS CAGR).

### Key Insight
The PEG ratio is a validation tool. Use it as a secondary check to confirm your buy/no buy decision. A low PEG combined with a CMP significantly below IV is the ideal scenario.

## Summary Table

| Step | Parameter | Formula | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **1** | P/E Ratio | CMP ÷ EPS | Current market valuation |
| **2** | Intrinsic P/E© | Average P/E (7-10 years, outliers excluded) | True long-term valuation anchor |
| **3** | Intrinsic Value (IV) | Intrinsic P/E© × Current EPS | Stock's true worth |
| **4** | PEG Ratio | P/E ÷ EPS Growth Rate (%) | Validation of valuation vs. growth |

## Key Takeaway

These four calculations transform subjective market opinion into objective business analysis. Follow the steps, use reliable data, and exclude outliers. The result is a clear picture of what the stock is worth and whether the current price represents a bargain.
