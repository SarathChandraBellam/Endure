# 3.4 The Buy/No Buy Decision

After completing the calculations in Round 2, you arrive at the most important moment: the decision to buy or not to buy. This decision is based on objective criteria, not gut feeling or market trends.

## 3.4.1 Primary Decision: CMP vs. Intrinsic Value

### The Buy Signal

**The stock is a "Buy" when the CMP is significantly below the Intrinsic Value (IV).**

### The 20% Rule (Common Guideline)

**Enter the market when CMP is more than 20% below the intrinsic value.**

This provides a **margin of safety**—a buffer against:
- Calculation errors
- Unforeseen business changes
- Market volatility
- Temporary business setbacks

### Formula
**Margin of Safety (%) = [(IV - CMP) ÷ IV] × 100**

### Example: Buy Signal
- **Intrinsic Value (IV)** = ₹500
- **Current Market Price (CMP)** = ₹380
- **Margin of Safety** = [(500 - 380) ÷ 500] × 100 = **24%**
- **Decision**: **Buy** (CMP is 24% below IV)

### Why 20%?
- It provides a cushion for uncertainty.
- It ensures you are getting a genuine bargain, not just a fair price.
- It increases the probability of significant upside when stock homecoming occurs.

### Variations
- Conservative investors may demand 30% or more.
- Aggressive investors may accept 15%.
- Adjust based on your risk tolerance and confidence in the analysis.

## The No Buy Signal

**A "No Buy" decision is required if:**

1. **CMP is significantly higher than IV**
   - The stock is overvalued by the market.
   - Even if the company is excellent, the price is too high.

2. **CMP is close to IV (within ±10%)**
   - The stock is fairly valued.
   - There is no margin of safety.
   - Wait for a better entry point.

3. **CMP is above even the "most optimistic value"**
   - If you calculate multiple scenarios (pessimistic, realistic, optimistic), and CMP exceeds all of them, it is a clear "No Buy."

### Example: No Buy Signal
- **Intrinsic Value (IV)** = ₹500
- **Current Market Price (CMP)** = ₹550
- **Margin of Safety** = [(500 - 550) ÷ 500] × 100 = **-10%**
- **Decision**: **No Buy** (CMP is 10% above IV)

## 3.4.2 Validation: PEG Ratio Check

The PEG ratio serves as a **secondary validation** to confirm your buy/no buy decision.

### PEG Ratio < 1 → Undervalued

**Interpretation**: The stock is likely undervalued. The current P/E is justified by the growth rate.

- If CMP is also below IV, this **strengthens the buy signal**.
- Example:
  - P/E = 20
  - EPS-GR = 25%
  - PEG = 20 ÷ 25 = **0.8**
  - **Signal**: Undervalued → supports a "Buy" decision

### PEG Ratio > 1 → Overvalued

**Interpretation**: The stock is likely overvalued. The P/E is too high given the growth rate.

- If CMP is also above IV, this **confirms the no buy signal**.
- Example:
  - P/E = 30
  - EPS-GR = 15%
  - PEG = 30 ÷ 15 = **2.0**
  - **Signal**: Overvalued → confirms a "No Buy" decision

### Using PEG as a Tie-Breaker

- If CMP is slightly below IV (say, 15% margin of safety), but **PEG > 1.5**, this suggests caution. Consider waiting for a better entry point.
- If CMP is slightly above IV, but **PEG < 1**, this suggests the stock may still be worth buying if you believe in strong future growth.

**Key Rule**: Do not let PEG override the primary CMP vs. IV decision. Use it as a validation tool, not the sole decision maker.

## 3.4.3 Calculation Quality Check

Before finalizing your decision, ensure your calculations meet quality standards.

### Intrinsic P/E© Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Extended Period**: Calculated over 7 to 10 years (minimum 7 years)
- [ ] **Outliers Excluded**: Market crash years and anomalies removed
- [ ] **Averaging Method**: Simple average or median (median is more robust if data has extreme values)
- [ ] **Data Source Verification**: Data sourced from reliable financial portals or company annual reports

### Example of Poor Quality Calculation
- Using only 3 years of P/E data → **Not reliable**
- Including the 2008 crash year without exclusion → **Distorted average**
- Using inconsistent data sources → **Unreliable inputs**

### Example of High Quality Calculation
- Using 10 years of P/E data (2014-2024)
- Excluding 2020 (COVID crash year)
- Verifying data from screener.in and company annual reports
- Using median instead of average to reduce outlier impact

## Decision Framework Summary

### Strong Buy
- **CMP is 20%+ below IV**
- **PEG < 1**
- **Intrinsic P/E© calculated with high quality data**
- **EPS growth is stable (confirmed in Round 1)**

### Conditional Buy (Use Caution)
- **CMP is 15-20% below IV**
- **PEG is close to 1**
- May proceed if you have high confidence in the business and future growth

### Wait / Monitor
- **CMP is within ±10% of IV**
- **PEG is close to 1**
- Stock is fairly valued; wait for a better entry point

### No Buy
- **CMP is equal to or above IV**
- **PEG > 1.5**
- Stock is overvalued; move on to the next candidate

## Real-World Decision Example

### Stock: ABC Ltd.

**Calculations**:
- **Current EPS**: ₹25
- **Intrinsic P/E©**: 22 (calculated over 10 years, outliers excluded)
- **Intrinsic Value (IV)**: 22 × 25 = **₹550**
- **Current Market Price (CMP)**: **₹420**
- **Current P/E**: 16.8
- **EPS Growth Rate (EPS-GR)**: 18%
- **PEG Ratio**: 16.8 ÷ 18 = **0.93**

**Decision Analysis**:
1. **CMP vs. IV**: CMP is ₹420, IV is ₹550
   - Margin of Safety = [(550 - 420) ÷ 550] × 100 = **23.6%**
   - ✅ **Strong Buy Signal** (>20% margin of safety)

2. **PEG Validation**: PEG = 0.93
   - ✅ **PEG < 1** → Undervalued, supports the buy signal

3. **Quality Check**:
   - ✅ Intrinsic P/E calculated over 10 years
   - ✅ Outliers excluded
   - ✅ Data verified from screener.in and company reports

**Final Decision**: **Buy**

## What Happens After You Buy?

Once you buy, the value analysis framework transitions from "should I buy?" to "should I hold or sell?"

### When to Revisit
- **Annual Review**: Recalculate intrinsic value once a year to account for changes in EPS and business fundamentals.
- **Major Business Changes**: If the company announces major acquisitions, leadership changes, or strategic shifts, recalculate immediately.

### When to Sell
- **CMP significantly exceeds IV**: If the stock price rises far above intrinsic value (e.g., 30%+ above IV), consider selling or trimming your position.
- **Business Deterioration**: If EPS growth becomes unstable or turns negative, reassess in Round 1 (Stability Check).
- **Better Opportunities**: If you find a stock with a higher margin of safety and better growth, rebalancing may be justified.

### When to Hold
- **As long as CMP is below or near IV and the business remains stable**, continue holding.
- Remember: Stock homecoming is inevitable. Patience compounds returns.

## Key Takeaway

The buy/no buy decision is not subjective. It is a disciplined process:

1. **Compare CMP with IV** (primary decision)
2. **Validate with PEG ratio** (secondary check)
3. **Verify calculation quality** (ensure reliability)

A "No Buy" decision is as valuable as a "Buy" decision. Protecting capital is as important as deploying it. Only buy when the numbers clearly justify it, and only when you have a genuine margin of safety.
