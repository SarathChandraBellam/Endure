# Endure

Endure is a disciplined investing perspective shaped by observation rather than theory. The framework is the product of repeated exposure to markets, corporate behavior, and the consequences of patience versus haste.

## Investment Perspective

Life is simple, and so is stock investing when the focus is placed on compounding businesses. Real estate can build assets, but businesses compound quietly while the impatient move on. Buying a stock is acquiring a stake in people, stories, and long-term outcomes, not merely a ticker.

## Foundational Insight

The initiative draws on the ideas captured in the book "Autobiography of a Stock" by Manoj Arora and the accompanying reflection "The Autobiography of a Stock." The central question is straightforward: why do so few investors create enduring wealth despite universal pursuit? The consistent answer is discipline, attitude, and the willingness to stay invested when momentum fades.

## Core Principles

The market does not owe returns; it rewards endurance. Four non-negotiable rules support that posture:

1. Never invest based on tips. Conviction matters more than consensus.
2. Never operate with a short-term horizon. Compounding demands time.
3. Never invest borrowed money or a borrowed mindset. Calm conviction requires ownership.
4. Remain a principled human with a constructive attitude. Investing reflects character more than intellect.
