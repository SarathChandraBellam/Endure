# 🕰️ Endure
 
Life is simple - and so is stock investing.  

That truth didn’t arrive overnight.  
It came slowly, through mistakes, through noise, through watching the market reward patience and punish greed.  

Over time, I realized that there is **no parallel to stock investing**.  
Real estate can build assets, but only businesses **compound**.  
And compounding is quiet — it happens while the impatient leave.  

When you buy a stock, you’re not buying a symbol or a chart.  
You’re **buying a part of a company** — its people, its story, and its destiny.  
You share its victories and its vulnerabilities.  
That realization changed everything.

## 🌱 The Realization

Endure was not born out of theory,  
but out of observation — of markets, of businesses, and of human behavior documented in a book called "**The Autobiography of a Stock**"

> Why do so few investors truly create wealth, when everyone is chasing it?

The answer wasn’t in spreadsheets or formulas.  
It was in **discipline**.  
It was in **attitude**.  
It was in **the willingness to stay** when others move on.

## 📜 The Principles

The market doesn’t owe us returns.  
It rewards endurance.  
And to endure, one must follow a few unbreakable rules:

1. **Never invest based on tips.**  
   The crowd is loud, but conviction whispers.  

2. **Never have a short-term horizon.**  
   Compounding needs time, not timing.  

3. **Never invest borrowed money — or a borrowed mindset.**  
   You can’t stay calm when the money isn’t truly yours.  

4. **Be a good human with a great attitude.**  
   Investing reflects character more than intelligence.

## 📘 The Inspiration

This guide draws from **_“Autobiography of a Stock”_ by Manoj Arora**,  
a book that personifies a stock and tells its story — from its birth at IPO to its rise, fall, and endurance.  

**Endure** based upon that philosophy,  
weaving together personal experience, timeless investing principles, and insights drawn from multiple trusted sources.  

This isn’t a rulebook.  
It’s a reflection — a guide to choosing businesses worth believing in and holding onto.

## 🔍 The Journey

Investing isn’t a single decision — it’s a series of understandings.  
Each round of *Endure* refines clarity, removes noise, and moves one step closer to conviction.  


**Round 0 – Initial Filter** | Discovery 

Each round has its own **markdown**, telling its own part of the story —  
how data turns into decisions, and decisions into conviction.

## 🧭 The Destination

The goal isn’t to find the next multibagger.  
It’s to **build a relationship with businesses that last**.  
Because the greatest edge in investing isn’t information — it’s temperament.  

We don’t need to predict.  
We just need to endure.
