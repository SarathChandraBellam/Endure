# 3.1 Core Philosophy

Investing in stocks is buying a part of a company, not just a piece of paper.

## Bargain Hunting

Great investors demonstrate infinite patience and wait for a bargain price that is much below the intrinsic value of the stock.

**Why It Matters**
- Waiting for the right price is not passive; it is active discipline.
- Patience compounds returns when combined with a sound entry point.
- The market will eventually offer bargains to those who wait.

## Safety and Logic

The process is disciplined and logical. A "No Buy" decision is as good as a "Buy" decision, if not more so.

**Why It Matters**
- Buying the wrong stock has far more disastrous consequences than simply missing a stock worth buying.
- Every "No Buy" decision preserves capital for the right opportunity.
- Discipline protects against emotional decisions driven by market noise.

## The Single Guarantee

There is only one guarantee in the stock market: **stock homecoming**.

**What This Means**
- A stock can divert from its intrinsic value for an indefinite period of time.
- But it is assured that it will come back home (hit its true intrinsic value) one day.
- The intrinsic value acts as gravitational center—the stock may orbit far from it, but gravity always pulls it back.

**Why This Matters**
- This principle provides the foundation for value investing.
- It explains why finding intrinsic value is critical—it tells you where "home" is.
- Patience is rewarded because homecoming is inevitable, even if the timing is uncertain.

## Key Takeaway

Value analysis is not about predicting tomorrow's price. It is about calculating true worth and waiting for the market to offer that worth at a discount. The philosophy is simple: buy well below intrinsic value, and let stock homecoming do the rest.
