# Round 0 – Discovery

The discovery round is a simple first pass. We scan trusted financial magazines and analyst blogs, pull their current buy recommendations, and build a list of 10–20 stocks that show up repeatedly.

- Sources must be reputable, research-driven, and current.
- We note where each idea came from, but we do not analyze the business yet.

Only the stocks that survive Round 0 move to Round 1. Any stock that fails a later round drops out permanently. The stock that clears every round is the one that earns our hard-earned capital.
